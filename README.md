## My process

My process started with coding all the HTML elements necessary for this project one by one, and styling them with CSS to allow myself to focus on completing one area of the design before I move on with the next one (divide and conquer approach). This structure is also applied in writing CSS, to allow for other people to easily navigate the code. After the HTML and CSS is set, I then proceeded with adding the accordion functionality via JS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design
- Vanilla JS
